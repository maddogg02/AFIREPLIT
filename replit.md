# AFI Management System

## Overview

This is a full-stack Air Force Instruction (AFI) management system built with React, Express.js, TypeScript, and PostgreSQL. The application enables users to upload PDF documents containing Air Force Instructions, process them into searchable chunks with embeddings, and interact with the content through an AI-powered chat assistant. The system provides document library management, structured search capabilities, and intelligent question-answering based on the ingested AFI content.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
